# Daily-Temperature-Time-Series

Daily-Temperature-Time-Series is model to predict temperaturein the city Melbourne, Australia using machine learning concept in time series dataset. The dataset contains data minimum daily temperatures over 10 years (1981-1990) in the city Melbourne, Australia.

This model implemented how to use LSTM when create model, use learning rate in optimizer, use callback, and how to plot the results of loss and accurcy, either in training or validation

This project is one of task in "Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula" course held by Dicoding and IdCamp Indosat.
